Challenge 18 Blockchain
In this application, I create a blockchain with a user interface. the ledger lets partner banks conduct financial transactions and verify the stregnth of the numbers in the ledger.

How i created this app.

I create a new data class named "Record". This data will be the benchmark.

then, I change "Block" data by replacing the generic data with a "record" attribute that's a type of data.
